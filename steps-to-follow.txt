This a list of the steps I take to solve any codewars problem:

1. Copy and paste the given function name into VS code
2. (Use code notes from here through step 4) Write out the main goal directly under the definition of the function 
3. Identify what to do if input == None or other special cases
4. Detail steps required to achieve main goal
5. Solve problem
6. Simplify solution
7. Submit solution

Helpful things to do that are not necessary:

1. We know that codewars wants us to use a return statement for the solution, so I always start by declaring a variable "result" and set it equal to nothing, 
then skip a couple lines and enter "return result". This way I'm ensuring my final return statement has correct indentation and allows me to use the 'result' 
variable to define my answer to the problem.

2. Look at the given test cases and copy at least 2 of the given tests and their expected result to form a function call and print statement after the function is 
closed. When you do this, grab an example of a tests that covers the range of possible data given.

3. With more difficult problems it may be useful to get more info using google and looking for trusted sources, or using chatgpt. If you use chatgpt, I suggest adding 
the phrase "without any visual representations" to any prompt or question you give it otherwise you will be tempted to copy and paste without learning what it does. 
Use the explanation from chatgpt to learn how to do what you want to do, you can always ask chatgpt for an example of code afterwards if needed.

This should help you complete any codewars or leetcode problem you are faced with.
