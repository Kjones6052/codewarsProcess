This a list of the steps I take to solve any codewars problem:

1. Copy and paste the given function name into VS code
2. before the pass statement, write the info given in notes
3. after pass statement use notes to write the expected outcome
4. start writing code according the steps detailed before the pass(replacing pass with this code)
5. when stuck consult chatgpt with a query that ends with "and do not use any visual examples or representations, just explain the steps"
6. solve the problem

Helpful things to do that are not necessary:

1. We know that codewars wants us to use a return statement for the solution, so I always start by declaring a variable "result" and set it equal to an empty array for 
this example, the skip a couple lines and enter "return result".

2. Look at the given test cases and copy at least 2 of the given arrays and their expected result to form a function call and print statement after the function is 
closed. When you do this, grab an example of a tests that covers the range of possible data given.

3. If you get confused by the explanations you recieve from chatgpt go to google with keywords to look up for more information or ask chat gpt to explain the specific 
information that is confusing to you.

This should help you complete any codewars or leetcode problem you are faced with.
